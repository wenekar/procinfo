# CONTRIBUTING

Hello there! Although this script may seem like it was designed to run on Linux machines only, I am actually targeting bash 3.2 (god bless Apple ig?) to keep this script readily available on macOS systems as well, so when making a PR, please make sure that:

- Runs on bash 3.2 (i.e doesn't use features introduced in 4 and onward)
- Runs on macOS (make a PR even if you can't run it directly, we'll test it out regardless~~)
- Does not introduce uncommon dependencies

That's it for now, may come back to this document later.
